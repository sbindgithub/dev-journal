# 1. Introduction to Warehouse Operations

Warehouse operations involve the systematic handling of goods from receipt to dispatch. The primary objective is to ensure accurate inventory management, efficient order fulfillment, cost control, and customer satisfaction.

Warehouse activities are broadly divided into:

- Inbound
- Storage
- Outbound
- Reverse Logistics

---

# 2. Inbound Operations

Inbound operations deal with receiving goods into the warehouse.

## 2.1 Pre-Receiving

- Advance Shipping Notice (ASN) from supplier
- Dock scheduling
- Yard planning
- Resource allocation (labor & equipment)

## 2.2 Receiving Procedure

1. Vehicle check-in and yard management  
2. Unloading of goods  
3. Physical inspection  
4. Quantity verification  
5. Quality check (QC)  
6. Data entry in WMS  
7. GRN (Goods Receipt Note) generation  

## 2.3 Objectives of Receiving

- Minimize dock-to-stock time
- Prevent discrepancies
- Ensure system accuracy
- Detect damages early

---

# 3. Putaway Process

Putaway is the movement of goods from receiving area to storage location.

## 3.1 Putaway Steps

- Labeling and tagging
- Storage location assignment
- Transport to storage area
- Recording bin location in system

## 3.2 Types of Putaway

### 1. Directed Putaway
WMS assigns optimal location based on:
- Item velocity
- Size
- Weight
- Space availability

### 2. Dynamic Putaway
Any suitable available location can be used.

### 3. Fixed Location
Each SKU has a predefined location.

# 4. Storage Management

Effective storage ensures space optimization and inventory control.

## Key Concepts

- Cubic utilization
- Accessibility
- Stock rotation (FIFO / FEFO)
- Cycle counting
- Bin location management

---

# 5. Order Processing (Order to Bill – O2B)

Order processing begins when a customer order is received.

## Steps

1. Order receipt (SO / STO)
2. Order verification
3. Picking list generation
4. Order fulfillment
5. Billing and invoicing

---

# 6. Order Picking Methods

Picking is one of the most labor-intensive warehouse activities.

## 6.1 Pick & Pack (Discrete Picking)
- One order picked at a time
- High accuracy
- Suitable for low volume

## 6.2 Batch Picking
- Multiple orders picked together
- Reduces travel time
- Efficient for common SKUs

## 6.3 Zone Picking
- Warehouse divided into zones
- Each picker responsible for a zone
- Orders move between zones

## 6.4 Wave Picking
- Orders released based on time waves
- Aligns with carrier schedules

## 6.5 Cluster Picking
- Multiple orders picked simultaneously into separate bins
- Ideal for e-commerce

---

# 7. Packing and Dispatch

After picking, goods are packed and prepared for shipping.

## Packing Activities

- Quantity re-verification
- Proper packaging
- Labeling
- Strapping (binding)
- Damage check

## Shipping Activities

- Load building
- Manifesting
- Documentation
- Legal compliance
- Delivery status tracking

---

# 8. Reverse Logistics

Reverse logistics handles returned goods.

## Reverse Process

- Return authorization
- Receiving returns
- Quality inspection
- Restocking / refurbishment
- Disposal if damaged
- Exchange or refund processing

---

# 9. Warehouse Documentation

## Inbound Documents
- ASN (Advance Shipping Notice)
- GRN (Goods Receipt Note)

## Internal Documents
- Put List
- Stock Transfer Order (STO)

## Outbound Documents
- Sales Order (SO)
- Picking List
- Packing List
- Transport Manifest
- Invoice

---

# 10. Container Sizes and CBM

## Common Container Types

- 20’ FCL (Full Container Load)
- 40’ FCL
- 40’ HC (High Cube)

## Measurement Units

- TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit)
- FEU (Forty-foot Equivalent Unit)

## CBM Calculation

CBM = Length (m) × Width (m) × Height (m)

Example:
2m × 1.5m × 1m = 3 CBM

CBM is used for:
- Freight cost estimation
- Load planning
- Space optimization

---

# 11. Value Added Services (VAS)

Additional services offered by warehouse:

- Kitting
- Bundling
- Repacking
- Label customization
- Cross-docking
- Customization based on customer requirement

---

# 12. Reporting & Analytics

Warehouse performance must be measured using KPIs.

Common KPIs:

- Inventory Accuracy %
- Order Fulfillment Rate
- Pick Accuracy
- Dock-to-Stock Time
- Inventory Turnover
- Space Utilization %

---

# 13. Factors Influencing Effective Warehouse Use

- Cubic utilization & accessibility
- Stock location management
- Order picking efficiency
- Physical control & security
- System integration (WMS / ERP / TMS)

---

# 14. Objectives of Efficient Warehouse Operation

- Efficient storage
- Accurate inventory management
- Timely order fulfillment
- Cost-effective operation
- Safety and security
- Continuous improvement

---

# 15. Cost of Operating a Warehouse

## 15.1 Capital Costs

- Warehouse rental or land cost
- Racking systems
- Material Handling Equipment (MHE)
- IT systems (WMS, scanners)

## 15.2 Operating Costs

- Labor
- Utilities
- Maintenance
- Administration
- Insurance
- Security

Labor typically forms the largest component of operating cost.
