Date: 10 Feb 2026

## 1. Warehouse Operations Overview

Warehouse operations are broadly divided into **Inbound**, **Storage**, and **Outbound** activities. The objective is to ensure smooth material flow with minimum cost, time, and errors.

### Inbound Operations
Inbound covers all activities from the arrival of goods to their placement in storage.

Key steps:
- **ASN (Advance Shipping Notice)**  
  Sent by supplier before shipment arrives. Helps plan dock, labor, and space.
- **Receiving**  
  Physical unloading of goods at the dock.
- **Inspection & Verification**  
  Quantity and quality checks against PO.
- **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)**  
  System confirmation that goods are received.
- **Put-away**  
  Movement of goods from receiving area to assigned storage locations.

Inbound KPI examples:
- Dock-to-stock time  
- Receiving accuracy  
- GRN cycle time

---

### Storage Operations
Storage is not “keeping goods”; it is **space optimization + accessibility + safety**.

Key concepts:
- Slotting based on velocity (Fast / Medium / Slow movers)
- Maximizing **storage yield**
- Maintaining aisle spacing for MHE movement
- Temperature-controlled storage (cold chain)

Benchmark:
- **85% space utilization** is considered optimal in industry  
  (Higher than this increases congestion and risk)

---

### Outbound Operations
Outbound starts when a customer order is released and ends at dispatch.

Key steps:
- Order picking
- Packing
- Labeling
- Dispatch
- Dock-out (truck departure)

Outbound KPI examples:
- Order fulfillment rate
- Pick accuracy
- Order cycle time
- Throughput (orders/hour)

---

## 2. Dock & Yard Management

### Dock Management
Controls the movement of trucks at inbound and outbound docks.

Includes:
- Dock door allocation
- Scheduling arrivals/departures
- Avoiding dock congestion

### Yard Management
Manages trucks, trailers, and containers inside the warehouse premises.

Benefits:
- Reduced waiting time
- Better labor utilization
- Faster turnaround time (TAT)

---

## 3. Downtime Utilization

Idle time is a **cost** if unmanaged.

Best practices:
- Skill development & training
- Cross-training white-collar and blue-collar staff
- Equipment maintenance
- Process audits

Goal:
Turn non-productive time into **capability building time**.

---

## 4. Safety, Compliance & Productivity

### Safety & Compliance
- PPE enforcement
- Clear aisle marking
- Load limit adherence
- Fire safety and emergency exits

### Prevention Focus
- Accident and injury prevention
- Regulatory compliance (local + international)

Outcome:
- Higher productivity
- Lower insurance and legal costs
- Better workforce morale

---

## 5. Types of Warehouses

### Based on Ownership
- Public
- Private
- Cooperative

### Based on Function
- Bonded warehouse (customs-controlled)
- Cold storage
- Distribution warehouse
- On-demand warehouse
- Smart warehouse (technology-enabled)
- Consolidated warehouse

---

## 6. Distribution Structures

- **DC (Distribution Center)**  
  Focuses on storage + redistribution
- **CFC (Customer Fulfillment Center)**  
  Order-based fulfillment (e-commerce heavy)

### Load Types
- **FTL / LTL**  
  Full Truck Load / Less Than Truck Load
- **FCL / LCL**  
  Full Container Load / Less than Container Load

---

## 7. Bonded & Customs Warehousing

Bonded warehouses store imported goods **without immediate duty payment**.

Associated locations:
- Seaport
- ICD (Inland Container Depot)
- CFS (Container Freight Station)

Benefit:
- Cash flow optimization
- Deferred customs duty

---

## 8. Layout & Design Planning

Warehouse layout directly impacts travel time and productivity.

Common layouts:
1. **U-shaped** – Receiving and shipping on same side
2. **L-shaped** – Suitable for space constraints
3. **I-shaped** – Straight-through flow, high throughput

Key design elements:
- Aisle spacing
- Rack height
- Dock positioning
- Material flow direction

---

## 9. Storage Optimization Concepts

### White Goods
Durable consumer goods (e.g., refrigerators, washing machines)

### Maximizing Storage Yield
- Proper racking
- Correct pallet selection
- Optimized aisle width

### 5S Principle (Japanese Method)
- Sort
- Set in order
- Shine
- Standardize
- Sustain

Applied to WMS and physical operations for discipline and efficiency.

---

## 10. ODC – Over Dimensional Cargo

ODC refers to cargo that exceeds standard size or weight limits.

Examples:
- Project cargo
- Heavy machinery
- Industrial equipment

Requires:
- Special handling
- Customized storage
- Route and safety planning

---

## 11. Technology Integration

### ASRS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System)
- Automated cranes or shuttles
- High-density storage
- Reduced labor dependency
- High accuracy

Used in:
- High-volume
- High-value
- Space-constrained warehouses

---

## 12. Containers & Identification

- Container number: **11 digits**
- Used for tracking, customs, and documentation

---

## 13. Cold Chain Logistics

Applies to temperature-sensitive goods:
- Pharmaceuticals
- Food
- Chemicals

Key requirement:
- **Temperature lock** across storage and transport

Failure leads to:
- Product spoilage
- Regulatory penalties
- Customer loss

---

## 14. Inventory Control Activities

- Stock supervision
- Reconciliation & put-away verification
- GRN-based inventory updates

Goal:
System stock = Physical stock

---

## 15. Material Handling Equipment (MHE)

Common equipment:
- Hand pallets
- Conveyor belts
- Forklifts

Impact:
- Faster movement
- Reduced manual effort
- Improved safety

---

## Summary – What You Must Remember

- Warehousing is **flow optimization**, not storage.
- Layout, technology, and people decide performance.
- KPIs drive behavior.
- Safety and compliance are non-negotiable.
- Smart warehouses win on speed, accuracy, and cost.
