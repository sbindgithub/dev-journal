# Day 4 – Inventory Management and Planning

## 1. What is Inventory?
Inventory refers to goods and materials held by a company for:
- Production
- Sale
- Supporting operations

Inventory exists to **balance demand and supply**, but it also ties up money.

---

## 2. Warehouse and Inventory Flow
A warehouse has three core activities:
- Inbound (receiving goods)
- Storage (holding inventory)
- Outbound (dispatching goods)

Inventory primarily resides in the **storage stage**.

---

## 3. Types of Inventory

### Raw Material
Basic materials used in manufacturing.

### Work In Progress (WIP)
Goods that are partially processed but not yet finished.

### Finished Goods
Completed products ready for sale.

### MRO Inventory
Maintenance, Repair, and Operations items that support production but are not sold.

### Merchandise Inventory
Goods purchased and sold without any transformation.

### Transit Inventory
Inventory that is moving between locations.

### Anticipatory Inventory
Inventory built in advance for known future demand (seasonal or promotional).

### Buffer Inventory
Extra inventory held to protect against uncertainty.

### Safety Stock
A **calculated portion of buffer inventory** used to protect against demand and lead-time variability.

---

## 4. Why Inventory Management is Important
Poor inventory management leads to:
- Stock-outs (lost sales)
- Dead stock
- Expiry and obsolescence
- Poor cash flow
- Low customer satisfaction (CSAT)

Good inventory management balances **availability and cost**.

---

## 5. Inventory Management Techniques

### Just In Time (JIT)
Inventory arrives only when needed, reducing holding cost.

### Just In Case (JIC)
Extra inventory is kept to manage uncertainty.

### ABC Analysis
Inventory is classified based on value:
- A: High value, tight control
- B: Moderate value
- C: Low value, simple control

### FIFO / LIFO
Methods to decide which stock is issued first.

### Dropshipping
Seller does not hold inventory; supplier ships directly.

### Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI)
Supplier manages inventory levels for the buyer.

### Cross Docking
Goods move directly from inbound to outbound with minimal storage.

### Cycle Counting
Continuous verification of inventory accuracy.

## 6. Inventory-Related Costs

### Holding (Carrying) Cost
- Storage
- Insurance
- Damage
- Obsolescence

### Ordering (Setup) Cost
- Purchase processing
- Transportation
- Administration

### Opportunity (Stock-out) Cost
- Lost sales
- Customer dissatisfaction

---

## 7. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

### Purpose
EOQ determines **how much to order** to minimize total inventory cost.

### Formula
EOQ = √(2DS / H)

Where:
- D = Annual demand
- S = Ordering cost per order
- H = Holding cost per unit per year

---

## 8. Reorder Point (ROP)

ROP determines **when to place an order**.

### Formula
ROP = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

---

## 9. Safety Stock Concept
Safety stock protects against:
- Demand variability during lead time
- Lead time uncertainty

Safety stock is consumed **only when actual demand exceeds expected demand**.

---

## 10. Concept Summary (Memory Aid)
- EOQ → Right quantity
- ROP → Right time
- Safety stock → Protection during lead time
- Buffer stock → General protection
- Anticipatory stock → Known future demand
