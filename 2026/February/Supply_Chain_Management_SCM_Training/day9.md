# Day 9 – Sourcing and Procurement

## 1. Introduction

Sourcing and Procurement are two distinct but connected components of the Source-to-Pay (S2P) cycle.

- **Sourcing** = Strategic activity focused on identifying and selecting the right supplier.
- **Procurement** = Operational activity focused on ordering, receiving, and paying.

Confusing these two reflects conceptual weakness. Keep them structurally separated.

## 2. Sourcing (Strategic Focus)

### Objective
Secure optimal supplier partnerships based on cost, quality, risk, and long-term value.

### Scope of Sourcing

1. Identifying business needs
2. Market research
   - Primary (trade fairs, physical visits, exhibitions)
   - Secondary (online databases, portals)
3. Supplier identification
4. RFI – Request for Information  
   → Collect capability details.
5. RFP – Request for Proposal  
   → Evaluate solution approach.
6. RFQ – Request for Quotation  
   → Compare final pricing.
7. Supplier evaluation
   - Technical capability
   - Financial health
   - Compliance and certifications
8. Negotiation
9. Contracting
10. Strategic supplier selection (long-term)

### Output
Signed contract / rate agreement.

## 3. Procurement (Operational Focus)

### Objective
Execute purchasing transactions under agreed contract terms.

### Scope of Procurement

1. Purchase Requisition (PR)
2. Approval workflow
3. Purchase Order (PO) issuance
4. Goods Receipt Note (GRN)
5. Three-way matching
6. Invoice approval
7. Payment processing
8. Record keeping

### Output
Transaction completed and payment released.

---

## 4. Three-Way Matching

A financial control mechanism before payment.

Documents involved:

- PO (Purchase Order) – What was ordered
- GRN (Goods Receipt Note) – What was received
- Invoice – What supplier billed

If quantity, price, and terms match → Payment approved.  
If mismatch → Discrepancy investigation.

## 5. RFI vs RFP vs RFQ

| Stage | Purpose | Usage Context |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| RFI | Gather supplier capability information | Early exploration |
| RFP | Evaluate technical solution and approach | Complex requirement |
| RFQ | Compare pricing | Final stage with fixed specs |

---

## 6. Market Research Sources

### Commodity Exchanges
- NCDEX – National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (India)
- LME – London Metal Exchange

### Supplier Discovery Platforms
- Alibaba
- IndiaMART
- Amazon Business
- Yellow Pages
- Trade fairs
- Embassy trade missions

These support strategic sourcing activities.

## 7. Incoterms (Example)

FOB – Free On Board  
Supplier delivers goods onboard vessel. Buyer pays main freight and insurance.

CFR – Cost and Freight  
Supplier pays freight to destination port. Buyer pays insurance.

---

## 8. Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)

Post-contract performance management.

Includes:
- KPI tracking
- Delivery performance monitoring
- Quality metrics
- Cost optimization initiatives
- Risk management
- Quarterly business reviews

Sourcing does not end at contract signature. Mature organizations integrate SRM into continuous improvement cycles.

## 9. Example: Steel Procurement Case

Company needs steel for manufacturing.

### Sourcing Phase
- Analyze market trends (e.g., LME pricing)
- Issue RFP to suppliers
- Evaluate responses
- Negotiate annual rate contract
- Select strategic vendor(s)

### Procurement Phase
- Raise monthly PO
- Receive steel (GRN)
- Perform quality inspection
- Execute three-way match
- Release payment

## 10. Source-to-Pay (S2P) Overview

S2P Flow:

Need Identification  
→ Strategic Sourcing  
→ Contracting  
→ Purchase Requisition  
→ Purchase Order  
→ Goods Receipt  
→ Invoice Matching  
→ Payment  
→ SRM

This end-to-end view is essential for system architecture design in ERP platforms.
