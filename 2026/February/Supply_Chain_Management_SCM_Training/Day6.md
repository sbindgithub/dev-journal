# Day 6 – Warehouse & Inventory Management

## 1. Key Logistics Concepts

### Consolidation
Consolidation refers to aggregating products from multiple suppliers into a single shipment destined for retailers or customers.  
Purpose: reduce transportation cost and improve shipment efficiency.

### Break Bulk
Break bulk is the process of dividing large bulk shipments into smaller quantities.  
Purpose: easier distribution, handling, and last-mile delivery.

### Dry Bulk
Dry bulk refers to non-containerized cargo transported in large quantities.  
Examples: grains, coal, cement, minerals.

## 2. Need for Warehouse Management

1. **JIT (Just-In-Time)**  
   Warehouses support synchronized supply with demand, minimizing excess inventory.

2. **Increased Complexity**  
   Product proliferation and growing SKUs require systematic storage and tracking.

3. **Growing Volumes**  
   Scaling operations demands structured inventory control and layout planning.

## 3. History & Evolution of Warehouse Management Systems (WMS)

### WMS 1.0 (Before 20th Century)
- Fully manual operations
- Paper-based inventory records

### WMS 2.0
- Computerization introduced
- Basic inventory and transaction tracking

### WMS 3.0
- Advanced systems (ERP-integrated)
- India and global adoption of automated warehouses

### WMS 4.0
- AI, IoT, Robotics
- Real-time visibility and predictive analytics

### WMS 5.0
- Future trends
- Autonomous warehouses, digital twins, hyper-automation

## 4. Inventory Valuation – FIFO

### FIFO (First In, First Out)
- Oldest inventory is sold first
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is **higher** during inflation
- Profit margin appears **lower**

### Formula
Opening Inventory + Purchases − Closing Inventory = COGS

---

## 5. Average Inventory

### Formula
Average Inventory = (Opening Inventory + Closing Inventory) / 2

Used for:
- Inventory turnover analysis
- Carrying cost calculation

---

## 6. Physical Inventory Counting

### Purpose
- Identify discrepancies
- Reconcile system stock vs actual stock

### Physical Inventory Process
- Full physical count
- Operations may be halted
- High accuracy

### Benefits
- High inventory accuracy
- Legal and financial compliance
- Correct asset valuation
- Discrepancy identification

---

## 7. Cycle Counting

### Definition
A periodic, partial counting method performed without stopping operations.

### Characteristics
- Quarterly / periodic / regular
- Focus on selected SKUs
- Minimal operational disruption

---

## 8. Physical Count vs Cycle Count

| Parameter        | Physical Count | Cycle Count |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Scope            | Entire inventory | Partial inventory |
| Frequency        | Annual / yearly | Frequent |
| Operational Impact | High disruption | Low disruption |
| Accuracy         | High | Moderate |

## 9. Components of Warehouse Management

1. Operations
2. Layout and Design Principles
3. Inventory Control Techniques
4. Labour Management
5. Safety and Compliance

---

## 10. Warehouse vs Godown

### Warehouse
- Systematic
- Handles high inventory volumes
- Structured layout and processes

### Godown
- Unsystematic
- Handles lower quantities
- Minimal process control

---

## 11. Warehouse Operations

### Core Activities
- Receiving
- Storing
- Dispatching

### OTIF
**OTIF = On Time In Full**  
A key performance metric in warehouse and supply chain operations.

## 12. Functions of a Warehouse

1. Storage
2. Inventory Management
3. Order Fulfillment (Picking & Packing)
4. Value-Added Services  
   - Assembly  
   - Packaging  
   - Labeling  
   (Enhance product value)
