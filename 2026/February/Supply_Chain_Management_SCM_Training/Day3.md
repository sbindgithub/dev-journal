# Day 3 – Inventory Management & Planning

## 1. Warehouse Flow
A warehouse operates through three core activities:
- **Inbound** – Receiving goods
- **Storage** – Holding inventory
- **Outbound** – Dispatching goods

Inventory primarily exists in the **storage** stage.

## 2. Types of Inventory

1. **Raw Material** – Inputs used for manufacturing  
2. **Work In Progress (WIP)** – Semi-finished goods  
3. **Finished Goods** – Ready-for-sale products  
4. **MRO Goods** – Maintenance, Repair, and Operations items  
5. **Merchandise Inventory** – Purchased and sold without transformation  
6. **Transit Inventory** – Goods in transportation (in containers, trucks, ships)  
7. **Anticipatory Inventory** – Seasonal or future-demand stock  
8. **Buffer Inventory** – General protection against uncertainty  
9. **Safety Stock** – Calculated portion of buffer inventory  

> Safety stock is a **subset of buffer inventory**.

## 3. Inventory Management Techniques
- **JIT (Just In Time)** – Minimize inventory holding
- **JIC (Just In Case)** – Risk-focused inventory strategy
- **ABC Analysis** – Inventory classified by value (A, B, C)
- **FIFO** – First In, First Out
- **LIFO** – Last In, First Out
- **Dropshipping** – No inventory held by seller
- **Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI)** – Supplier manages stock
- **Cross Docking** – No storage, direct transfer
- **Cycle Counting** – Continuous inventory auditing
- **EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)** – Optimal order quantity

## 4. Costs in Inventory Management

1. **Holding / Carrying Cost**
   - Storage
   - Insurance
   - Obsolescence
   - Damage

2. **Ordering / Setup Cost**
   - Purchase processing
   - Transportation
   - Administrative effort

3. **Opportunity (Stock-out) Cost**
   - Lost sales
   - Customer dissatisfaction

---

## 5. EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)

### Purpose
EOQ answers: **How much quantity to order?**

### Formula
EOQ = √(2DS / H)

Where:
- **D** = Annual Demand  
- **S** = Ordering / Setup Cost  
- **H** = Holding Cost per unit per year  

### Example
- Annual demand = 12,000 units  
- Ordering cost = ₹80 per order  
- Holding cost = ₹25 per unit per year  

EOQ ≈ **277 units**

Number of orders per year = 12,000 / 277 ≈ **43 orders**

---

## 6. Reorder Point (ROP)

ROP answers: **When to order?**

### Formula
ROP = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

---

## 7. Safety Stock

### Purpose
Safety stock protects against:
- Demand variability during lead time
- Lead time uncertainty

### Simple Understanding
Safety stock is consumed **only if demand exceeds expectations** during lead time.

---

## 8. Key Memory Aids
- **EOQ** → Right Quantity  
- **ROP** → Right Time  
- **Safety Stock** → During lead time  
- **Buffer Stock** → General protection  
- **Anticipatory Stock** → Known future demand

## 9. Importance of Inventory Management
- Prevents stock-outs
- Avoids dead stock and expiry
- Improves cash flow
- Enhances customer satisfaction (CSAT)

Dead stock leads to **expiry, wastage, and financial loss**.
