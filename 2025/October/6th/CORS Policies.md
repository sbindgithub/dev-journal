👉 [Securing Web API in .NET core](https://github.com/sbindgithub/dev-journal/blob/main/2025/October/6th/securingWebAPIin.NETcore.md)

What is CORS?

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
It’s like a security guard that decides who is allowed to talk to your server.

🏠 Think of it like this:

Imagine your server is a house, and your website (frontend) is a person trying to enter it to get data.

If the person (say, from your own house or same area) comes — the guard says, “You’re from this house, you can come in.” ✅

But if a stranger from another area (another domain) comes — the guard says, “Wait! Who are you? I’ll only let you in if my owner (the server) says it’s okay.” 🚫

That’s CORS — a rule that decides which websites (origins) can call your API or access your server’s data.

🧩 Example:

Let’s say your website runs at:

https://myapp.com


And your API runs at:

https://api.myserver.com


When your website tries to call the API, the browser says:

“Hey API, this request is coming from https://myapp.com
 — do you allow that?”

If the API replies with a header like:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myapp.com


Then the browser allows it ✅

If not, the browser blocks it ❌ and shows:

“CORS policy error: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header present”

🔒 Why is it needed?

Because without CORS, any random website could secretly call your API and misuse your data — like stealing user info or making fake transactions.
So CORS is basically a browser safety rule to protect users and servers.

⚙️ In short:
Situation	Allowed?	Why
Same domain (same origin)	✅	Safe, no CORS check
Different domain, but allowed by server	✅	CORS header present
Different domain, not allowed by server	🚫	CORS policy blocks it
