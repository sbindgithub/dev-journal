What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?

Middleware in ASP.NET Core is a software component that‚Äôs executed in sequence on every HTTP request and response.
Each middleware can inspect, modify, or short-circuit the request before it reaches the next component in the pipeline.

Common examples include authentication, logging, exception handling, and serving static files.

üó£Ô∏è Impressive way to say it:

‚ÄúYou can think of middleware as a pipeline of filters where each one performs a specific cross-cutting concern such as logging, authentication, or compression before the controller executes.‚Äù

üîÅ 2. How is the Request Pipeline Structured?

The pipeline is sequential and follows the order in which middleware are registered in the Program.cs or Startup.cs file.

Each middleware can either:

Call the next middleware using await _next(context), or

Short-circuit the pipeline (e.g., if authentication fails).

This ensures predictable and efficient request handling.

üó£Ô∏è Bonus phrase that impresses:

‚ÄúMiddleware order defines the application behavior ‚Äî for example, authentication must come before routing, and exception handling should wrap the entire pipeline.‚Äù

üß± 3. Common Middleware Components
Built-in Middleware	Purpose
UseRouting()	Defines the routing system for endpoints
UseStaticFiles()	Serves static content like CSS, JS, images
UseAuthentication()	Validates credentials and sets user identity
UseAuthorization()	Checks user‚Äôs permissions and access control
UseEndpoints()	Maps routes to controllers or Razor pages
UseExceptionHandler()	Catches and handles exceptions globally
UseCustomMiddleware()	Custom user-defined logic

üó£Ô∏è Strong closing statement:

‚ÄúIn most real projects, I‚Äôve used middleware for logging, security headers, authentication, and static content delivery. I‚Äôve also implemented custom middleware for request tracing and performance logging.‚Äù

üí° Pro Tip to Impress

When asked to explain middleware, you can mention a quick example:

public class LoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) => _next = next;

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context); // call next middleware
        Console.WriteLine($"Response: {context.Response.StatusCode}");
    }
}


‚ÄúI‚Äôve created similar custom middleware to log user activity and request duration in our Maersk project to improve debugging and monitoring.‚Äù
