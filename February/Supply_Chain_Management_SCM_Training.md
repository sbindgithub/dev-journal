# Supply Chain Management (SCM) – Training  
## Day 1: Fundamentals of Supply Chain & Logistics

---

## 1. Introduction to Supply Chain Management (SCM)

Supply Chain Management refers to the **end-to-end coordination of activities** involved in the movement of goods, services, information, and finances from raw material suppliers to the final customer, and in some cases, back again (returns).

The objective of SCM is **efficient, cost-effective, and timely delivery** while meeting customer expectations.

---

## 2. Core Components of SCM

The primary components of Supply Chain Management are:

1. **Logistics**  
   Physical movement and storage of goods, including transportation, warehousing, and distribution.

2. **Planning**  
   Demand forecasting, supply planning, capacity planning, and resource optimization.

3. **Sourcing (Procurement)**  
   Vendor selection, contract negotiation, and procurement of raw materials or services.

4. **Manufacturing / Make**  
   Conversion of raw materials into finished goods, including production scheduling and quality control.

5. **Inventory Management**  
   Managing stock levels to balance service levels and carrying costs.

---

## 3. Supply Chain Planning Process (SCOR Model – Simplified)

Supply Chain activities can be broadly classified into:

- **Plan** – Forecast demand, plan capacity and inventory  
- **Source (Procure)** – Acquire raw materials  
- **Make (Manufacture)** – Produce goods  
- **Deliver** – Transport and distribute products  
- **Return** – Handle returns and reverse logistics  

This lifecycle defines how modern supply chains operate.

## 4. Logistics as an End-to-End Process

Logistics is not just transportation. It includes:

- Supply chain coordination  
- Warehousing  
- Transportation  
- Distribution  
- Reverse logistics (returns)

Logistics supports multiple business models such as:
- Manufacturing supply chains  
- E-commerce  
- Quick commerce (Q-commerce)

---

## 5. First Mile, Mid Mile, and Last Mile Delivery

- **First Mile**  
  Movement of goods from suppliers or manufacturers to large Distribution Centers (DCs).

- **Mid Mile**  
  Movement between warehouses, hubs, or fulfillment centers.

- **Last Mile**  
  Final delivery from warehouse or hub to the customer.  
  This is the **most expensive and customer-visible** part of logistics.

---

## 6. Key Performance Metrics

- **KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**  
  Measures performance efficiency.  
  Example: On-Time Delivery, Cost per Shipment, Inventory Turnover.

- **KRA (Key Result Area)**  
  Responsibility-focused outcome areas tied to roles.

- **OTIF (On-Time In-Full)**  
  Measures whether the delivery reached the customer **on time and with complete quantity**.

---

## 7. Containerized vs Non-Containerized Cargo

- **Containerized Cargo**  
  Goods transported in standard containers.

- **Non-Containerized Cargo (Bulk / Break Bulk)**  
  Examples: Crude oil, ores, heavy machinery.

**Draft** refers to vessel depth requirement, critical for heavy-weight cargo.

---

## 8. Documentation & Compliance

- **E-Way Bill (India)**  
  Mandatory document for movement of goods beyond prescribed value limits.

- **GST Compliance**  
  Required for domestic movement of goods.

- **Customs Clearance**  
  Mandatory for import/export shipments.

Compliance failures directly cause **delays and penalties**.

---

## 9. Logistics Infrastructure & Facilities

### Warehousing
Storage facilities used to hold inventory before distribution.

### ICD & CFS

- **ICD (Inland Container Depot)**  
  Located away from seaports; connected via road or rail.

- **CFS (Container Freight Station)**  
  Located near seaports; used for consolidation and deconsolidation.

## 10. Sub-Sectors in Logistics (Overview)

There are **12 major logistics sub-sectors**:

1. Warehousing  
2. Land/Road Transportation  
3. Courier & Express Logistics  
4. Port Terminals / ICD / CFS  
5. EXIM Logistics  
6. Air Cargo Operations  
7. Cold Chain Logistics  
8. E-Commerce Logistics  
9. Inland Waterways & Marine Services  
10. Supply Chain Services  
11. Liquid Logistics  
12. Rail Logistics  

---

## 11. Upstream and Downstream Flow

- **Upstream Flow**  
  Raw materials, components, and supplier activities.

- **Downstream Flow**  
  Finished goods, customer delivery, cash flow.

Additionally:
- **Information Flow** moves both ways  
- **Returns Flow** enables reverse logistics

---

## 12. Forward vs Reverse Logistics

- **Forward Logistics**  
  Supplier → Manufacturer → Warehouse → Customer

- **Reverse Logistics**  
  Customer returns, repairs, recycling, disposal

Reverse logistics is critical in **e-commerce and retail**.

---

## 13. Third-Party Logistics (3PL)

3PL providers manage logistics activities on behalf of companies, including:

- Transportation  
- Warehousing  
- Distribution  
- Freight forwarding  

They enable businesses to focus on core operations.
